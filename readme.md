# EDI dumps

Dumps (text or binary) of save-data and other files for the game Escape Dead Island. Used to aid in research.


## Save-data

After each or every few save-points, the file containing the saved game's state has been kept and numbered (file name "save_data<number>"). Using the tool **EdiSaveDataDump** from the [EDI tools repository](https://github.com/SteffenL/EscapeDeadIsland), the save-data for each saved game has been nicely sorted and formatted into a human-readable format (file name ends with ".txt"). This allows us to use a diff-tool to see the changes between each save-point.
